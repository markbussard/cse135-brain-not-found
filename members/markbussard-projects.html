              Outside of my academic school programming assignments and my work,
              I also enjoy exploring new technologies, whether it's a framework,
              new language or an API. These days it's usually anything web related.
            </p>
            <p>
              By working on my own projects, I'm able to revisit any problems I've
              encountered in the past, and figured out better approaches to go about
              solving them. Essentially figure out what I wanted to do differently
              (maybe not exactly, but similar) and implement it to see any improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've especially become interested in realtime enabled features, such as
              Chat applications, or through collaborative work in writing through text editors.
